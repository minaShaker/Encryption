1.  it's a header file wich allows us to use and manipulate integers much better ,
some of the variables defined in it is int8_t which equals to 1 byte or char uint8_t this is unsigned int , we can increase the size until we reach 64 bits = 8 bytes 
2.  uint8_t decide what is the size of the int variable despite the compiler so uint_8 equals exacley 8 bits 1 byte and it's unsigned , which mean 
it can hold bigger positive numbers so we are creating this deftype to be able to hold on the data from header of bmp 
we use it int_8 or uint_8 to control the exact size we are gonna use and not making the compiler decide for us  , we use uint_8 for bigger positive numbers
3.  BYTE =1 byte, a DWORD = 4 bytes, a LONG = 4 bytes, and a WORD = 2 bytes
4.  42 4D
5.  bfsize is the size of the file (all of it) the size of the image + the badding + the 2 header files 
bisize is the size of the structure of BITMAPINFOHEADER which is 40
6.  biHight is negative means that the start of the picture is from the top left means from high to bottom
7.  biBitCount
8.  in line 24 the mode 'r' the file might be not excist or it's open by another file , or no permission to read this file , the file could be write only
in line 32 the mode is 'w' the file might be open by another program or there is no space to create new file , or no permission to make new file the file could be read only
9.  because the thirs argument from fread is how many times to read , so we make it 1 cause we want to read only once 
10. 3
11. if i want to change the offset of the pointer to make it point to somewhere else 
12. when we use fseek() if we put seek_cur it will change the pointer position in relation to the current position of the file pointer
which means if we write fseek (filepointer , number of bytes you want to change the position to(offset) , the place from which you want ot start counting (whence))
so if we put seek_cur it will start counting from where we stand
